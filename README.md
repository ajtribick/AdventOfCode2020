# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 competition. No promises are made about
whether or not these are *correct* or even *good* solutions. ðŸ™ƒ

Projects are set up so they can be run via `cargo run --bin dayNN` (replace NN
with the day number, prefixed with 0 when less than 10) from the workspace
directory, and unit tests can be run with `cargo test -p dayNN`, or
`cargo test --all` to run unit tests for all days.
