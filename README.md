# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 competition. No promises are made about
whether or not these are *correct* or even *good* solutions. ðŸ™ƒ

Projects are set up so they can be run via `cargo new --bin dayN` (replace N
with the day number) from the workspace directory, and unit tests can be run
with `cargo test -p dayN`, or `cargo test --all` to run unit tests for all
days.
